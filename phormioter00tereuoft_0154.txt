following Kritz, and apparently Madvig, ξ 88, obs. 1, maintain that quis
and quid merely ask for the name, but qui and quod (interrogative)
inquire respecting the kind, condition, or quality of the person or thing.
The truth seems to be that in many cases the substantival use of quis
and the adjectival use of qui are attended with this distinction of mean·
ing, which naturally arises from the form of the sentence, e. g. Eun. 823-4
T H. Quis fuit egitur? ΡΥ. Iste Chaerea. ΤΗ. Qui Chaerea ,⁹ But
that this distinction is not inherent in the actual words quis and qui is
clear from the fact that quis est Phormio? quid est remedium? would
require the same answer as qui Phormio? quod remedium? and that
Cicero uses qui before a consonant, quis before a vowel. In many cases
where quis seems to be used adjecti vally the irregularity is only apparent,
e. g. And. 965 quis homo est ? ‘who is there ?' is literally ‘ who is the
man?’ Verg. G. 2. 178 quis color, ‘ what is its distinguishing colour'ss '
