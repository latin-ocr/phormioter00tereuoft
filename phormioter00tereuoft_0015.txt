an after-picce, like the Satyric drama among the Greeks, and
was regularly performed by professional actors. The name
Atellanae, from Atella, an Oscan town near Capua, gave rise to
the erroneous supposition that these farces were performed at
Rome in the Oscan dialect ; whereas it was only in accordance
with Roman custom to give to dramatic performances a local
name which could offend no national prejudices. The records
of these plays are scanty, but they appear to have presented
extravagant caricatures of special classes, trades, or occurrences,

or introduce Roman topics. Even the rustic raillery and
amateur farces of early Rome had to lay their scene in Tuscan
Fescennia or Oscan Atella.

Contaet with Greek oivffleation. Moreover, in addition
to a national deficiency of literary instinct and ignominious legal

centuries the Romans had been engaged in a varying, yet almost
ceaseless struggle for supremacy, or even for existence. The
defeat of Pyrrhus, 274 B.c., and the final conquest of Tarentum
and the other cities of Magna Graecia a few years later, lest
