Ac'r ΙΙΙ. SCENE 4. [IV. 4.]

Antipho, who was entirely in the dark as to the scheme between
Phormio and Geta, had overheard with amazement and dismay the
arrangement by which he was to lose his beloved Phanium. As soon
as the old gentlemen are gone he fiercely assails Geta, who has some
difficulty in assuring him that the whole affair is only a temporary ruse
to get the money, and that there is no real cause to sear the actual
accomplishment of the projected marriage between Phanium and
Phormio.

682. emunxi argento senes, ‘ I have cleaned the old gentlemen out
of their money.’ Cf. Gr. ἀπομύσσεσθαι, applied to a drivelling old
man.

683. satin id est? etc. ‘Is that all?’ ‘I really don't know: it was
all my orders? Geta purposely misapplies Antipho's question to the
amount of money demanded. Literally satin id est?= ‘ are you satisfied
with that?

684. verbero, ‘ you scoundrel.' Cf. mastcg‘z'a, Ad. 781.

685. ergo is often used as an emphasising particle, especially in
questions and commands. ‘ What then do you mean?’ Cf. 755 note,

689. Here the MSS. read huic mandes quod quidem recte curatum
velie, which cannot stand aster si quid velis and is almost certainly a
gloss from Ad. 372 huic mandes, si quid recte curatum velis. The
reading in the text is found in the margin os E and F. Tr. ⁴ Here’s a.
pilot to take one out os smooth water on to a reefi’
