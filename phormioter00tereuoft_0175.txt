1047. discedo, ‘I get off‚-' colloquial. Cf. 773. The persons among

Cantor. A Roman Comedy was divided into spoken dialogue in Ι

Iambic Senarii (diverln'az‘¹ and the passages in any other metre which were
delivered to a musical accompaniment (cantica). The term Canticum
was also used in a more restricted sense to denote a lyrical monologue‚
of which Plautus has numerous examples‚ Terence only three, and those
very short, Andr. 481-5‚ ib. 625—638‚ Ad. 610-6. ’

We leam from Livy 7. 2 that, in 'order to save his voice. Livius
Andronicus placed a boy on the stage to sing the words of cantica, while
Livius himself acted the part in dumb show. This practice was adopted
by others, and it seems from Hor. A. P. 155 donec Cantor ‘vos plaudite'
dicat* that the usual request for applause was uttered by this singer, who
is to be distinguished from the accomp'anist Tibicen.

It is, however, possible that ‘ Cantor’ in Hor. A. P. m‘erely means
‘ actor‚' as Cicero pro Sest. 55. 1 18 uses cantores as equivalent to
histriones.

In all Terence's plays the MSS. mark the speaker of plaudite by ω.
Bentley thought this to be a corruption of CA. (for Cantor , but, as the
actors are often indicated by letters of the Greek alphabet in the order
of their appearance. it is more probable that ω was appropriated to the
speaker of the last words.
