NOTES. LJNES 138-154. 121

152. hoo, i. e. the money paid to him by Davus.

Doroio. Dorcium was probably Geta's wife. Female names often
nded in -ium, an endearing diminutive, e. g. Phanium, Glycerium.
A slave’s marriage was not recognised at law either at Athens or Rome.
Strictly the woman was in Latin a contubernalis, though practically she
is sometimes termed uxor, e. g. Ad. 973.

Ac'r Ι. SCENE 3.

The young men, Antipho and Phaedria, appear in conversation. The
former is dreading his father’s return, the latter reproaches his cousin
sor his saint-heartedness‚ and contrasts his own love-lom condition
with that of Antipho, who is in full possession of the object of his
affections.

153. adeon rem redisse, ‘to think that things have come to such
a pass? Terence often uses the Ace. and Inf. to express excited or
indignant exclamations and questions, as also Cicero, Livy, etc.

·ne is frequently found in such forms, because a question is implied
if not expressed‚ e. g. 339; but naturally -ne is not used if the clause
begins with non, e. g. 232-3.

redisse. For the spelling see 5 5 note, 460, etc.

qui mihi consultum optume velit esse, ⁴ though he is anxious
for my best interests,’ a common phrase, consultum esse being used im·

154. ut, repeated from line above. The clause patrem ut extimescam
should be taken before qui mihi etc.

ubi in mentem eius adventi venit, ‘ when a thought of his
arrival occurs to me.’ This construction of venire in mentem with
a Genitive is not unsrequent in Cicero, e. g. Sull. 6. 19 cum matro-
narum ac virginum veniebat in mentem. The phrase is almost equiva-
lent to meminisse in meaning and so takes the same construction. It
may be impersonal as here, or personal with the subject thought of in
the nominative, as Liv. 8. 5 non venit in menlem pugna apud Regillum
lacum. Cf. Madv. ξ 291, obs. 3. All MSS. give venit. except that the
late corrector of A has introduced an A, whence most editors read
ventizt.

adventi, archaic sor adventus. In Old Latin the Gen. of U-Stems
ended in mos. In Terence a form in -uis once occurS, Heaut. 287
anuis. but the Gen. in ·i‚ as though srorn an O·Stem, is common.
Only the form -as is employed bv Augustan writers, but Ennius.
Lucretius, Plautus, and Terence use both forms side by side. We find
