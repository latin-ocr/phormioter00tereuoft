144 PHORMIO.

301. miseritum est, ‘poor fellow.' The full phrase is found Pl.
Trin. 430 me eius miseritum est. The tense here seems to be an imi-
tation of the so-called ‘immediate' Aorist in Greek. In English we
should use the Present, ‘ I pity him.’

veris vincor, ‘ Ι can't gainsay the truth.’
quam uterque est similis sui, ‘ how true to his character each is,’
i. e. ‘How like Antipho ! how like Phaedria !’

502-3. neque . . . malum! ‘and to think of my being confronted
with this trouble just when Antipho had been engrossed with a similar
anxiety.' In this rendering neque alia is taken as=et non alia, following
Stallbaum. That Antipho was so engrossed is seen from 506. Mr. R. C.
Jebb (quoted by B. and W.) translates, ‘ And then to think that this
blow shouldn't have befallen me when A. had some love trouble on
hand too.' Wagner changes neque to atque ‚· Zeune supposes vellem to
be understood after neque ; Paumier conjectures aeque for neque.

autem is often added like Gr. δὴ as an emphatic particle, espe-
cially in questions where some reproach is implied. Cf. 601, 775, 788.

504. quoi quod amas domi est, ‘you who have at horne the object
of your love.’

505. Connect cum malo huius modi and translate, ‘and have never
experienced the shock of a trouble like this ;' conflictaris = conflictaveris;
cf. Andr. 93 nam qui cum ingeniis corssz'ctatzcr eius modi.

506. auribus teneo lupum. A wolf is difficult to hold and dan—
gerous to let go. Donatus quotes the Greek proverb, τῶν ὤτων ἔχω
τὸν λύκον· οὔτ’ ἔχειν οὔτ’ ἀφεῖναι δύναμαι. Cf. ‘ I've caught a Tartar.'

508. ipsum . . . est, ‘that is exactly my case with him?

ne . . . sies, ‘ Oh! don't be a scoundrel by halves;' or possibly
‘you are afraid of being a scoundrel by halves,’ cf. Pl. Pers. 4. 6. 4,
313 note. In Augustan Prose ne with Pres. Subj. is only used in
general prohibitions.

509. confecit, ‘has he settled?’

511. ancillam, sc. vendere.

512. ut me maneat, ‘ to give me time.'

eum 1110 . . . fidem, ⁴ to break saith with his customer.'

515. obtundes, sc. aureS, ‘ will you keep dinning this into me?
obtundere aures, ‘to beat at the ears‚' comes to mean ‘to importune,’ or
⁴ to annoy by constant repetition,' like the Hellenistic use of ὑπωπιάζειν,
St. Luke 18. 5 (B. and W.). Cf. Andr. 348.

exoret sine: sino may be followed by a Subj. with or without ut,
or by an Infin. 3 cf. 517.

510. ‘ He too will surely repay you twofold for any service you may

have rendered.' '
