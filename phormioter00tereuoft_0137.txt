NOTES. LINES 305-319. 133

composition either ·duce or ²—duc. A always gives the shorter form
if the mette does not require the longer, except in Heaut. 744
TRADVCEHVC: conversely the later MSS. always read the longer
form except sor metrical reasonS, e. g. Eun. 377, and one MS. F which
gives traduc in Heaut. 744. Of Imperatives usually syncopated Plautus
sometimes writes dice, duce, never fere, and in both the comic poetsface
often appears, but only at the end of lines, e. g. 397, 674. Otherwise
Terence uses the shortened forms. The rule in Augustan Latin was
to use exclusively dic, duc, fer, fac, and similarly in the compounds of
duco, sero, and those of flzcio which retain a in the stem3 but other
compounds of facio and those of dico retain the final e: e. g. educ, affir,
calefac, but αυεβα», edice.

311. The order is, Ego devertar lzinc domum salutatum deos penatis.

313. adsient, archaic for adsint. Terence uses siem, sies, siet, sient:
also possiem, possiet, adsz‘et. Cf. 446, 508, 514, 635, 675, 773, 806, 822.

314· ut ne. Cf. 168 note.

Ac‘r ΙΙ. Scene 1 [2]..

In the interval between the Acts Geta has met Phormio and informed
him of the arrival and the anger of Demipho. Phormio is confident

which he has preyed upon the wealthier citizens, and describes the
delightful freedom from anxiety enjoyed by a parasite.

admodum, ‘certain1y.’ An affirmative answer may also be expressed
by etiam, ita, factum, oppido, sane, scilicet, sic, vcro, verum, etc. ε or by
repeating the verb, e. g. hoc facies? faciam .· or by a pmnoun, e. g. hoc
jacies? ego vero. Cf. 316, 382, 524, 811-12.

oppido, ‘ very much so,' a colloquial word, found in Cicero's
Letters, etc.. but not in his Orations; obsolete in the time os Quintilian.
The derivation is doubtful. Festus says it arose from a frequent answer

Whence oppido became equivaleut to ‘ valde multum.’ Cf. 763, 896.

318. tute hoc intristi ς tibi omne est exedendum, a proverb, lit.
