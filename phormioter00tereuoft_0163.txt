Ac‘r IV. SCENE 2. [V. 3.]

Demipho re·appears from his brother's house escorting Nausistrata,
who has consented to inform Phanium of the proposed arrangements.
N ausistrata is eloquent on the feebleness of Chremes as compared with
her father.

784. age dum. cf. 594 note.

786. re dudum, ‘just now with your money.' Cf. 681, and for
dudum 289 note.

Distinguishsactum volo, ‘ Ι am glad it is so ; ’ factum velim, ‘ I hope it
may be so ;'factum vellem, ‘ I wish it were so.’ So toofactum nolo, etc.

788. quid autem Ρ ‘why, what do you mean ’ζ’ Cf. 503 note.

790. statim, ‘ regularly,' only ante-classical in this case.

The subject of capiebat is Nausistrata’s father.

791. ‘ Yes, two talenta and that when prices were much lower.’

792. quid haeo videntur? scilieet. This question and answer are
obscure. The meaning may be, (1) ‘ What do you think os this? ‘ ‘Of
course you are right :' or (2) ‘ What! do you think so?’ (referring to
Demipho's hui! of admiration). ‘Of course 1 do.’ Hence Colman‘s
translation, ‘Whatl are you surprised Τ ‘Prodigiously.' In any case
Demipho's scilicet is not likely to be either ironical or absent, as
supposed by some, since he is very anxious to pay Nausistrata every
attention.

natum, the reading of A, is more characteristic of Nausistrata
than natam.

793. parce sodes, ‘please spare yourself.’ Cf. 103 note.

794. oum illa, sc. conloqui. Demipho expected a scene.
