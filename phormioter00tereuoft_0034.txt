30 ,INTROD UCTION.

times scans nempe as ηέρἔ e. g. 307 ndmpe Phdrmz'o'nem. Note
also that milzz' and nihil are usually considered as monosyllabic,
whether they are written as mz' and nil or not ε but cf. 176, 940.
It seems probable that visum est, noxia est, etc., were pro-
nounced vz'sum’st, noxz'a’st‚ and the accents have been placed
accordingly.

Besides the ‘ Iambic Law’ and the points above mentioned‚·
there are other causes of difference between Terentian and
Augustan prosody.

I. Indifference to double consonante, which Terence pro-
bably did not write. Thus ille is often used as a pyrrhic (υ υ),
and less frequently essse, etcum, quippe, immo, etc. ; possibly
also such cases as supellectile 666, decidito 143, etc., may be ·
thus accounted for. Cf. Lucr. 6. 1135 cdruptum :corruptum-

ΙΙ. Retention of the quantity of final syllables originally
long. This is very rare in Terence. Of the nineteen instances
quoted by Wagner in his Terence, Introd.‚ p. 14, only two are
certain, viz. Phor. 9 stelit, Ad. 25 augeat. These instances
confirm the opinion that -z't of perf. ind. and -at of pres. subj.
were originally long, while there is more doubt with reference
to the same terminations in other tenses. In 315 dis is doubtful.
In the older poets‚ Ennius and Plautus (cf. Ritschl, Prol. 175),
such long syllables are common, especially -or (-ωρ) in nouns,
adjectives, or verbs, -at‚ -εί, -z't in third pers. sing. of verbs.

Lucretius seldom permits himself this licence. Mr. Munro
admits only two instances of -et (though this termination is
always long in Ennius), while -ᾰί and -z‘t never appear except
as contracted forms for -avz't‚ -z‘z't. Vergil freely lengthens -ον,
-εν, -ιιν, us, -at (imperf), -et, -z‘t, but only in arsz'S, and usually
when a pause follows the word. Note, however, that Vergil
does not confine himself to syllables originally long, but admits
such quantities as super, puer, caput, procul, and frequently
-que5 in imitation of the Homeric τε before double consonants.
Ovid regularly lengthens periit, subiit, rediit, etc. Horace
lengthens syllables in arsis about ten times.
