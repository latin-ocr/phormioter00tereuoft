10 , INTRODUCTION.

the Laws of the Twelve Tables the Fescennine verses became
merely a generic name for improvised songs, not always very
refined, at weddings, triumphS, or other festal occasions. ι

Saturae. According to Livy 7. 2, the first ‘ ludi scenici’ were
introduced at Rome 361 B. C. to appease the anger of the gods
who had sent a pestilence on the city.

It seems certain that about this time a stage was erected in
the Circus at the Ludi Maximi, and the first three days of the
festival were henceforth occupied with recitations, music and
dancing. Performers from Etruria, called ludiones, danced to
the music of the flute without words or descriptive action ; but
the strolling minstrels of Latium (grassatores, spatiatores) soon
took advantage of the stage to recite their chants with appro—
priate music and gesture. These performances were named from
their miscellaneous character Saturae ¹. They were composed
in the rugged Saturnian metre, with no connected plot, and did
not admit of dialogue.

Fabulae Atellanae. A nearer approach to dramatic {orm
was made in the Fabulae Atellanae, broad farces with stock
characters, e. g. Maccus, Pappus, Bucco, and Dossenus, ana—
logous to the clown, pantaloon‚ and harlequin of an English
pantomime. Each character had its traditional mask, and the
pieces were originally played only by amateurs at private
theatricals3 but when translations from Greek dramas had
monopolised the Roman stage, the Atellan farce was adopted as

In rabiem coepit verti iocus, et per honestas

Ire domos impune minax. Doluere cruento

Dente lacessiti, fuit intactis quoque cura

Condicione super communi, qut-'n etiam lex

Poenaque lata, malo quae nollet carmine quemquam

Descriln' .· vertere modum formidine sustz‘s

Ad bene dicendum delectandumque redacti.

¹ From lanx satura, a dish of mixed food. The later Saturae or

Miscellanies, with which we are familiar from the works of Horace,
Juvenal, and Persius, were introduced by Lucilius, who died 103 B.C.
