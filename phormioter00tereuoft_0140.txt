1 36 PHORMJO.

356. After 355 is inserted in the MSS„

PH. lVec Stilphonem ipsum scire qui fuerit? GE. lVegat.
This must be a gloss, as is shown clearly by 386-9.

357. ignoratur, ‘is disowned.' Cf. Pl. Trin. 264, Verg. A. 6. 615,
780.

358. vide avaritia quid facit. Note the Indicative. ‘ In conversa-
tional or animated language a question is osten put logically though not
grammatically dependent on another verb or sentence, e. g. on such ex·
pletives as dic mihi, loquere, cedo, responde, expedi, narra, vide: rogv,
volo scire, fac sciam, viden, audin, scin, etc. So frequently in Plautus
and Terence, even where later writers would make the question depen-
dent and use the Subjunctive. Compare, ‘Tell me, where are you? ' and
‘ Tell me where you are.‘ Roby ξ 751. Cf. 987.

359. Geta, as well as Phormio, is of course playing a part, intending
‚to be overheard by Demipho·

male audies. Cf. 20 note.
360. Tr. ‘ What impudence 1 he is actually going to prosecute me.'
ultro, lit. ‘ beyond what might be expected: ’ contrasted with
sponte, which merely means ‘willingly.’ Here Phormio does not wait
to be made a defendant, but intends, as Demipho thinks, himself to
prosecute. This meaning of ultro may be expressed here by emphasising
the pronounS. Cf. 769. O! au· seems to scau as one sylable. Cf. 259.
362. illum, se. Phanium's father, cf. 357.
norat=n0verats Indic. because the supposition was represented as
a fact.
iam grandior, ‘ of some considerable age! Notice this use of the
Comparative ; cf. Vergil's iam senior etc.

363. quoi in opere vita erat, ‘who worked for his livelihood.'

365. interea, ‘ during that time.’

366. The order is, narrabat hunc cognatum suom neglegere se.

367. quem ego viderim etc. ‘ the most worthy man perhaps that I

have seen in my life.' The Subjunctive probably qualifies what would
otherwise be a downright statement, as is done in English by ‘per—
haps’ .
368. videas te atque illum, ut narras, ‘ compare yourself and him
according to your account,' i. e. ⁴ what a contrast between such an excel·
lent man as you describe and a rascal like yourself.' The meaning must
be uncomplimentary to account for Phormio's rejoinder. Some explain
thus, ‘ do you see to your stories about yourself and him. it is nothing to
us : ’ or, ‘ see what lies you are telling about yourself and him.'
Bentley’s version, vidisti nullum ut narras, has the merit of sim-
plicity. For scansion of I in, cf. 2 59, 360 notes.
