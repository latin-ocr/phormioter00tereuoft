 

ΝΟ TES. LINES '501—533. 145

eondupnoaverit. A Fut. Perf. is often used by Plautus and
Terence to express a future action to be quickly and certainly per·
formed, where in English we should employ a Fut. Simple. Cf. 681,
882, etc.

518. horun0=h0rum-ce‚ cf. 290.

519. neque ego neque tu, ‘it won't be my doing nor yours either ;'
i.e. it is Phaedria's fault for not paying over the money.

quod es dignus. In early Latin dignus is sometimes constructed
with an Acc. neuter pronoun, cf. Plaut. Capt. 969 non me censes scire
quid dzgrnus siem ?

duint. Cf. 123 note.

521. eontra omnia haec. Some editors, believing that contra is not
used as a preposition as early as Terence, put a stop after haec, under·
standing sunt. But though the adverbial use is much more common,
contra is found as an undoubted preposition Pl. Ps. 155 adsistite omnes
contra me, ib. Pers. 1. 1. 13; and it is far more natural to take itas
such here and in the parallel passage Ad. 44 illc contra haec omnia
Ruri agere vitam.

522. da locum melioribus, said to have been a formula used by a
Consul’s lictors in clearing the way.

524. quam ad, so all MSS. If the reading be correct, this is a rare
instance of ad standing after its case. Bentley conjectures quoad.
Tr. ‘unless my memory deceives me, there was assuredly a date once
fixed by which you wereto pay him.' Cf. Cie. Nat. D. 2. 4 Senatus,
quos ad soleret, referendum censuit.

factum. Cf. 3¹5 note.

525. haee, sc. the date on which the other purchaser appeared.

526. vanitatis, ‘ bad saith.' The quality most prized by the Romans
was gravitas, a solidity of character on which full reliance could be
placed. opposed to this was vanitas, ‘fickleness‚’ ‘ untrustworthiness.’

dum ob rem. ‘provided it pays) In a similar sense we find in
rem Andr. 546, and ex re 969, in an opposite sense ab re Pl. Trin. 238.

527. sic aum: etc. ⁴ ’Tis my way. If you like it, deal with me. '

528. immo enimvero, ‘nay, in very truth.'

532. dare ne dixit— daturum se dixin We find several instances in
Terence where a Pres. Ins. is used instead of a F utute Ins„ e. g. Andr.
379, 411, 613, Ad. 203, infra 720, 837. Compare the use os the Pres.
Iud.. 486 note. The idea os intention implied in these cases makes the
Pres. equivalent to a Future. So also in Plautus, e. g. Most. 3. 1. 99,
ib. 5. 2. 21.

533. ,mea 1020 utar etc. ⁴ 1 will follow my rule, “ first come, first
served.'
