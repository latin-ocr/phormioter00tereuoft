- 113. enim. Terence often uses enim or nam as a particle of em·
phasis; cf. 332, 338, 487, 555, 694, etc. In 983 enim in this sense begins

employ the same idiom, and there is a similar use of γάρ in Greek,
especially in ἀλλὰ 7dp=sed enim. Cf. 615 note.

enough in colloquial language‚ e. g. 383, 447, 519, etc.; cf. 38, 440

doubtful whether nonne was found in the original MSS. of these writers,

nonne 768, Andr. 238, 239, Ad. 660. Cf. 260, 392, 525, 856. Non is
sometimes thus used in spoken language by later writers, e. g. Cic.
Cat. 1, Liv. 4. 4, etc. ’

tense cf. 108 note.

understood. It is common in the indignant or excited rePetition of a
question asked by another3 e. g. 382, 685.

123. homo confidens, ‘an impudent rascal.' Confidens usually in
a bad sense, but cf. Andr. 855. Note homo· here, homa‘ 411.

In this sense it is common in Horace, Cicero, etc.
