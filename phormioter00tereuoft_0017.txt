New Comedy. The N ew Comedy was alone available. This
was the name given to a school of dramatists, of whom ⁸the best
known are Philemon, Diphilus, Apollodorus of Carystus, and
above all Menander. They wrote at a period (340-260 B.C.)
when the power of Macedon had crushed the liberty of Greece.

of Comedy were fairly numerous ’·’, but only two have bequeathed

rests on his Epic poem, also adapted Greek plays, chiefly tragedies, to
the Roman stage.
