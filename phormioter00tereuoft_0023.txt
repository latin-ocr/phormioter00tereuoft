PHORMIO: PLOT ΛΝΒ CHARACTERS. 19

THE PLOT AND CHARACTERS OF THE
PHORMIO.

The scene of this play is, as usual, laid at Athens. The
characters of the two old men, so familiar to readers of Terentian
comedy, are represented by the brothers Demipho and Chremes,
Athenian citizens of good position and some fortune. The
former has a son named Antiph03 the latter is husband to
Nausistrata, of whom he stands in considerable awe, and father
of Phaedria. Nausistrata has inherited from her father pro·
perty in the island of Lemnos, whither Chremes goes year by
year to collect the rents and realise the produce of the farms.
While on one of these visits he clandestinely marries, under the
feigned name of Stilpho, a Lemnian lady, and has by her a
daughter named Phanium, born sixteen years before the opening
scene of the play. This family is supported out of the income
derived from the property of Nausistrata, who imagines that it is
only one example of Chremes’ general incapacity that he brings
home so much less money than the estate formerly yielded.

Demipho is aware of this unlawful connexion, and has more-
over agreed to marry his son Antipho to Phanium, passing her
off as a distant relation of the family.

The play opens at a time when Demipho and Chremes are
both absent from Athens, the former in Cilicia on a visit to an
old friend who promised him a most profitable investment, the
latter on a journey to Lemnos, whence he intends to bring
Phanium for the projected marriage with Antipho. Upon his
arrival, however, he finds that both mother and daughter have
left the island in search of him. Theyarrive safely, but being
unable to discover any one in Athens named Stilph0‚ are reduced
to great poverty and distress. Overcome by her anxieties the
mother falls ill and dies, leaving Phanium in charge of a trusty
old nurse, Sophrona.

During this period the two young men Antipho and Phaedria
