(b) Iambie 'I'etrameter Acataleetic, called octonarius
from its eight complete feet. (1 16.)

(c) Iambio 'Petrameter catalectie, called septenarius
from its seven complete feet. (57.)

(d) Iambic Dimeter Aeataleetie, or Quaternarius. (3.)

These lines consist in their pure form of iambi3 but the
spondee, tribrach, anapaest‚ and dactyl are admitted in all feet
except the last, which must be an iambus, unless, of course, the
verse is catalectic. Moreover, as the Tetrameter is Asynartete‚
i.e. regarded asbeing composed of two verses, with the division
after the fourth foot‚ that foot is usually an iambus; and such
words as ego, tibi, cedo, are allowed to stand there as if at
the end of a senarius. In any iambic metre an anapaest is
occasionally resolved into a proceleusmatic (υυυυ), which is
most commonly in the first soot‚ and composeci of two distinct

pairs of syllables. Cf. 48, 133, 276, 370, 394, 707, 733, 762,
768, 776 795 966 968 983. 999·

ΙΙ. TROCHAIC.

(a) 'I'roohaie 'I'etrameter Aeataleetic‚ or octonarius, (19.)
(b) 'I'rochaio 'I'etrameter Cataleetio, or Septenarius. (237.)

(c) 'I'roehaie Dimeter Cataleotic. (2.)

These lines consist in their pure form of trochees; the
spondee, tribrach, anapaest, and dactyl are also admitted. But
only the trochee‚ tribrach, and sometimes dactyl are found in
the seventh foot of the Septenarius. In Trochaic Septenarii
the last syllable is always considered as long: cf. 318, 319,
321. Trochaic, like Iambic Tetrameters, are considered to be
divided aster the fourth foot, but in neither metre is this division
constantly observed. As the Trochaic metre is more quick
and lively than the Iambic, it is naturally employed in scenes
where strong feeling and excitement are represented.

Besides the above, 48 5 is an irregular line, apparently con-
sisting of one trochee with a syllable over.
