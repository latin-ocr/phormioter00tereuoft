840. ostium concrepuit. F olding doors were in general use among
the Greeks and Romans, hence the pl. sores, valvae. These seem to
have opened either outwards or inwards, andso it was customary for a
person leaving a house to rattle or knock. the door as a warning to
those without. This noise is usually described as in the text. The
door is said crepare, or concrepare, Gr. ψοφεῖν. Hence some have
thought (see Ramsay, Mostellaria 2. 2. 23—5) that crepare merely
refers to the creaking of the hinges, but Ad. 788, and Most. 2. 2. 74-5,
seem decidedly against this view. A person knocking (usually) from
without is said, pellere, pulsare, pultare, less commonly percutere,
Gr. κόπτειν, κρούειν, ἀράσσειν. Tr. ‘ there’s a noise at your door?

abs te, ‘ at your house.’ Cf. 188, 732 notes.
