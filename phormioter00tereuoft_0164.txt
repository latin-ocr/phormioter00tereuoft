Aer IV. SCENE 3. [V. 3.]

As Demipho and Nausistrata approach the house, Chremes comes
out in great excitement from an interview with his daughter. He wants
of course to stop any further proceedings with reference to Phanium,
but -finding Nausistrata with Demipho he cannot explain matters
Demipho gets impatient and Nausistrata suspicions at his inexplicable
conduct and manifest agitation, and only with great difficulty does
Chremes get his wife safely back into her own house, so that he can
impart to his brother the news which he has been bursting to tell.
