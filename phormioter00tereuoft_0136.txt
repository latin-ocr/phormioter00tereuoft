lit. ‘nothing indulgent has been deserved' sc. ‘by them? The Pers.
Part. Pass. of mereo is used by Cicero, Livy, etc., though not osten.

commonstrarier. Cf. 92 note.

307. ne(m)pe‚ often scanned thus in Plautus and Terence, when the
first syllable is unaccented. In some MSS. it is then written nepe. See
Introduction on Prosody, p. 30.

308. iam faxo hio aderit, ‘ Ι will setch him here at once.'

faxo. Plautus and Terence use the following: faxo (Ind.)‚ faxim
(Subj.) faxis, faxit (Iud. or Subj.)‚ faximus (Subj.), faxitis (Ind. or
Subj.)‚ faxint (Subj.). Cf. 554.

Three views are held with regard to these forms :—

(1) They may be syncopated forms for secero, fecerim, etc.; cf.

Zumpt. ξ 161, Peile Etymology‚ p. 197.

’ (2) They may be archaic futures, formed exactly like the Greek by
adding -so to the verb—stem, e. g. fac-so=faxo as vpa7-0oe=vrpdfm; the
tense in -sim being the Subjunctive; cf. Roby, ξς 291-3, Madv. ς 115 f.

(3) King and Cookson (p. 463) consider saxo, faxim, amasso,
amussim, etc„ to be conjunctive and optative forms of the sigmatic
aorist. Cp. 742.

The philological uncertainty is not removed by the practical usage
of these forms. In the present passage it is quite an open question (cf.
681 note), but faxo is often used where a Fut. simple would naturally
stand, and in Ad. 847-8 is a direct co-ordinate of faciam Fut. The
Subjunetive form is never used as a Perf. Subj.‚ but always as aFut.;
cf. the epitaph of Ennius,

Nemo me lacrimis decoret nec funera fletu

Faxz't. Cur ? volito vz'vu' per ora virum ,-
the common phrase di faxint expressive of a wish, Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 38
cave faxis, and the use of ausim. Vergil, Livy, Ovid, and Horace
occasionally employ these forms, and di faxint is found even in Cicero.
Cf. 742 note. As regards construction faxo is followed four times in
Terence by the Fut. Ind., here, 1055, Eun. 285, 663, thrice by the Pres.
Subj.‚ Ad. 209, 847 (placed after the Subj.)‚ and Andr. 854. It is also
constructed with an Acc. and a Pers. Part. pass„ infra 1028. Probably
the Indicative is grammatically independent: cf. 358 note. Augustan
writers always use the Subjunctive construction.

foris, ‘out,' an Abl. plur. of the obsolete fhra, used as an adverb

meaning ‘rest out of doors: ’ sosorasd ‘motion out of doors.'
