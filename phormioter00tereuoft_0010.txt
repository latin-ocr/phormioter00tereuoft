6 ' PREFACE.

It is hoped that the stage directions, which have been
mainly suggested by practical experience at Westminster,
may be of real service.

Constant use has been made of the editions of Umpfenbach‚
Fleckeisen, Dziatzko, Wagner, Bond and Walpole,-—the first
two on textual questions only‚—with less frequent reference
to those of Bentley, Zeune (containing the commentaries of
Donatus), Stallbaum, Parry, and Davies. References are
made to Roby’s School Latin Grammar as more likely to be
generally accessible than his larger work.

I have to thank my former fellow-worker, C. E. Freeman,
Esq„ of Park House School, Southborough‚ to whose
accurate scholarship our editions of the T rz'nummus and
Andria owed so much, for his courteous permission to
make use of any matter which appeared in one of the
Plays above mentioned as our joint production. I must
also express my obligations to the Rev. R. F. Dale for his
kindness in reading through the notes and making some

valuable suggestions.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.

THE whole work has been carefully revised, and, it is
hoped, improved. Among my critics I have especially to
express my obligations to my friends, the late Mr. J. H. Onions
of Christ Church, and ΜΓ. St. G. Stock of Pembroke College,

Oxford, several of whose suggestions have been adopted.
