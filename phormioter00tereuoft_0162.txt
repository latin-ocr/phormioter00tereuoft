fulfilment of the compact. Geta himself is by no means easy with
regard to his own prospects of escaping punishment.

766. nostrapte. Cf. 172.
ut malos expediat esse, ‘ that it pays to be a rogue ; ' cf. Heaut.
388 expedit bonas esse vobis.

767. diei nos bonos studemus. Note that in Augustan Latin a
predicative word following an Infin. and referring to a subject in the
Nom. is itself in the Nom„ e. g. Bibulus studet fieri consul. Cf. Ad.
504, Madv, ξ 393.

768. ita fugias, ne praeter oasam, sc. fugias, ‘in running away,
don't pass the house’ (i. e. your master's); a proverb applicable to a
runaway slave, something like ‘don't jump out of the frying-pan into
the fire‚’ or ‘don't go farther and sare worse.' Demipho means that in
trying to get out of one trouble he is running the risk of a worse.
Casa, properly a ‘hut,’ ‘ cottage‚' might be easily applied in slaves’
slang to the master's house, ‘the diggingS.’ Another interpretation is,
‘in running away, don't pass your house,' which is the safest place
for you. But the application of this to Demipho’s present circumstances
is not obvious. ΜΓ. Stock renders ‘ More haste, less speed.’

nonne. Cf. 119 note.

769. etiam argentum est ultro obiectum, ‘ we have, actually
thrown money to him as well,’ i. e. like a sop to Cerberus. Cf. Verg.

it by this plan of his marrying her.·' discedi, cf. 1047, Andr. 148 ε possiet,
impersonal ; for the archaic form see 313 note. The marriage of Phormio
with Phanium is of course meant. For ut introducing a wish see 687,
711.

774. haud scio . . . an mutet animum, ‘ 1 really don't know whether
he won't change his mind.’ The English idiom requires a negative
in the second clause, because lzaud scio an suggests ‘probably,’ but ‘ 1
don’t know whether' suggests ‘ probably not.’

ut homo est. ‘ being human ;' a thoroughly Terentian touch.
ut, ‘seeing that.’

775. mutet autem? ’ ‘ what? change?' Cf. 503 note.

777. ista, i. e. Phanio; hano, i. e. Nausistratam.
