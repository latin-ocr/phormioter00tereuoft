PROSODY. 29

7 penultimate, if that syllable were long, on the antepenultimate,

ἢ is the penultimate were short: e. g. se'nex, regebat, re'xerit.
=. special stress on one syllable tends to diminish the length

of its neighbours.' Accordingly there was a natural ‘tendency

-’ to shorten the final syllable of an Iambus, and to obscure or drop
’ final consonants: and this tendency was greatly strengthened
7 ‘when the metrical ictus coincided with the word-accent. When

however the two did not coincide the verse-accent prevailed

7 over the word-accent. This is most frequently exemplified in
anapaestic feet of an Iambic line, when the metrical ictus
³ on the third syllable os a bacchius u—-L changes it to an
„ anapaest υ υ -4,

Α, Conversely the ictus sometimes makes long a syllable which
s would otherwise have been short.

The final consonants most frequently disregarded are ¹m,—
hence its elision even in Augustan poetry before a vowel or lt,—

, which is often omitted in inscriptions: ²5, as constantly in

’ ιιιςτεῐίιιε7εῑηά the older poets‚ especially when u precedes;
and to a lesser extent d, l, ⁶72, r, t. Terence often avails
himself of this licence, e. g. 660 incertz'c's sum at the end of

7 a senarius,

Similarly opus est, factus est, etc.‚ may always be scanned
opu’st, sactu'st when convenient, e.g. 715, 833, etc. So also

. amatus es may metrically be amatu’s. It was doubtless too in
γ accordance with ordinary pronunciation that Terence some—

, ¹ Quint. 9. 4. 40, m parum exprimitur. Priscian 1. 38, m obscurum
J in extremitate dictionum sonat. So in Terence enl(m) vero, quietiore),
1 etc„ and probably n might be dropped in i(njde, ixn)pluvium, cf. 707,

etc. Compare also dedere sor dederunt.

² Cic. Or. 161. Quod iam subrusticum videtur, olim autem poli·

s tius, eorum verborum, quorum eaedem erant postremae duae litterae
.- quae sunt in ‘optumus‚’ postremam litteram detrahebant, nisi vocalis

insequebatur. Ita non erat ea ffnsio in versibus quam nunc
fugiunt poetae novi. Ita enim loquebamur ‘qui est omnibu' prin-

oepsf non ‘omnibus princepS‚' et ‘vita illa dignu' locoque,‘ non

‘ dignus!
