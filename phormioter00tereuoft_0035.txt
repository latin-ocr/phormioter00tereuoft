ACCIDENCE AND SYNTAX. 31

111. synizesis or synaeresis, Almost any two vowels not

, separated by a consonant may be contracted into a single
ἒ- syllable. This is most common in the case of pronouns and
s deus, e. g. Hem, tffm, mZZrum, huz-us, ems, devs] but we also
” find re-tcere 18, next—0 193, thctius 182, ότι-ας 754, dehortatus:

dortatus 910, quszd 148, etc. Sometimes a word made mono-

* syllabic by synizesis is then elided, e. g. meum 232. In Terence
= debinc and proin are always of one syllable, antehac of two. On
ν the contrary, nunc iam is always scanned as minci‘dm, and is Ι

printed accordingly (diaeresis). Augustan poets employ Synizesis
sparingly, chiefly in making consonantal i or u, as abiete, ariete
= ⁴abjete, arjete,· tenuia = tenvia, and in cases of nouns or ad-

jectives ending in -eus‚ e. g. aure—a.

1V. Hiatus is admitted,

(1) when there is a change of speaker, e. g. 146, 542, 963 ;

(2) when the line is broken by a strong pause, e. g. Ad.
5743

(3) after an interjection, e. g. 411, 753, 803.

Note that O seems to form one syllable with the following
vowel by a kind of Synaeresis in 259, 360, 853. Occasionally
a long final vowel, or a vowel before m, is shortened and not
elided in the case of a monosyllable, e. g. qul aget 27, ne
agas 419, te Idem 426 probably, qudm ego 808, εἴ habet 1041.
Cf. 383, 501, 883, 911, 954, 982, 1005. Lucretius has eleven
instances of this (see Munro’s note on 2. 404), Vergil six, e. g.
Ecl. 8. 108 an qul amant. Cf. Madv„ 502 b.
