154 PHORMJO.

694. 11011 enim. Cf. 113 note.

696. in nervom. Cf. 325 note.

701. tandem, ‘after all‚’ so used Luer. 5. 137. An easier reading
would be tamen, but no MS. gives it.

702. vocandi, ‘ for issuing invitations.’

705. monstra [monestra, fr. moncel. Omens, termed generically
auspicia, augum'a, were divided by the Romans into five classes—

(1) ex caelo, e. g. thunder and lightning.

(2) ex avibus, which gave omens by their note (oscines), or by their
ssight (alites).

(3) ex trz‘pndz‘z's, i. e. from the seeding of the sacred chieken.

(4) ex quadrupedibus, only used for private divination.

(5) ex diris, i.e. any portentous event, not otherwise classified;
such were called prodzg’z'a, portenta.

Tr. ‘ how many things have proved ominous to me since that event ἒ ’

postilla. Cf. 347 note.

706. introiit scans as a dactyl, z'ntrdit, the final syllable being first
contracted‚ ef. 5 5, and then sh01teued by the Iambic Law. See Intro·
duction, p. 27. A black dog or cat has usually been considered
‘ uncanny.’ Mephistopheles appears to Faust as a black poodle.

707. inpluvium, also ‘ confluvium: ‘the skylight,’ a quadrangular
opening in the roof of a Roman atrium, through which smoke went out
and rain came in; also sometimes the square basin sunk in the floor
which received the rain. The second soot must be scanned as a pro-
celeusmatic, pe⁹r inplzivt‘ Ι um. To avoid this many editors print in for
per.

708. gallina cecinit, ‘ a hen crowed.’ sc. like a cock. This was an
omen, according to Donatus, that the wife would survive the husband.

708-9. hariolus, haruspex, synonymous terms sor a soothsayer who
interpreted omens from the entrails of victims (Sans hira = entrails).
The art soon fell into disrepute among the educated classes, cf. 492 note.
Note that the whole system of omens at Rome had a practical bearing.
The signs warned men to do or not to do some act, and so the auspices
were taken or soothsayers consulted before any undertaking of import-
ance in public or private life. Cf. Hor. Od. 3. 27. 1-7—

lmpz'os parrae recinentis omen

Ducat, ct praegnans canis, aut ab agro

Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino
Felaque vulpes .·

Rumpat ct serpens iter institutum,

Si per obliquum similis sagittae

Terruit mannos. sqq.
