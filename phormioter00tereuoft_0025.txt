PHORMIO: PLOT AND CHARACTERS. 21

his determination to seek legal advice and fight the matter out
with Phormio.
Aet 11 introduces us to Phormio, who confidently assures

' Geta that he will make everything all right, and gives a lively

picture of a parasite’s easy life. The conversation is interrupted

, by the appearance of Demipho (Sc. 2) with three advisers.

Phormio at once assumes a high hand. He defies Demipho

his fiancle on pnyment of the sum of thirty minae as dowry for
Phanium.

Demipho is furious at this extravagant demand ; but Chremes,
