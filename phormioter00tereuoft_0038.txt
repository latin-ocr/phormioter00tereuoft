Besides these differences in Accidence and Syntax the plays
of Terence abound, as is natural, with words or phrases used in
a colloquial sense, cf. 47, 54, 79, 82, 133, 145, ete„ among which
may be specially mentioned proverbial sayings, cf. 78, 186, 203,
318, 419, 506, 686, 768, 780.

Tautologous and pleonastic phrases are also a characteristic
of comic diction, cf. 80, 89, 164, etc.

Greek wordS, though not nearly so frequent as in PlautuS,
occur oftener than in Augustan writers, e-g. dicam 127, asyma
bolum 339, eu 398, gynaeceum 862, logi 493, paedagogus 144,
palaestra 484, parasitus 28.

It should however be borne in mind that most of the above
points are characteristic not so much of Terence individually as
of the conversational language in vogue at that period; and
when writers of the Ciceronian or Augustan age descend from
the artificial style then affected in literary composition—as for
example Cicero in his Letters—many of these so-called pecu-
liarities reappear.
