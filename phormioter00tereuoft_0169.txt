hoo qui cogam, re ipsa repperi, ‘I have discovered means to screw
this out of them from the course events have taken.' cogere can take
a double Ace. of the person forced, and of the thing extorted : cf. Ad. 490.
891. angiportum hoo proxumum, ⁸ this alley hard by.' Both angi-
portus, mas. of the fourth decl. and angiportum, neut. of the second decl.
were in use. The term was applied to those passages leading off the streets
through a doorway, common in most old towns. Sometimes such a
passage was a thoroughfare‚ sometimes a ‘ cul de sac.'
893. non eo. Cf. 447 note.

Aer V. SCENE 1 [8].

On the reappearance of Chremes and Demipho from their interview
with Phanium, Phormio puts his new scheme into execution. He comes
to fulfil his engagement like a ‘ man of honour.’ Demipho makes very
lame excuses to annul the compact and demand back the thirty minae.
The parasite affects righteous indignation. He has already paid away
the money, and broken off his betrothal in order to marry Phanium.
If now this is not to be, the dowry at least must remain with him as
satisfaction for the false position in which their indecision has placed him.
Demipho waxes very angry and threatens summary justice; whereupon
Phormio discloses his knowledge of the Lemnian intrigue. Chremes is
utterly crushed. His brother urges him to make a clean breast of the
affair to Nausistrata, and promises his mediation. Stung almost to frenzy
by Phormio’s taunts, Demipho tries to drag him off to the law-court. The
parasite on his side attempts to get to the door of Chremes' house.
There ensues a violent struggle, ended by the appearance of Nausistrata,
who has heard the stentorian shouts of Phormio.

894. gratias habeo atquo ago. The regular usage was to say
gratiam habeo. ,but gratias aga.
896. This line is found in the MSS. after 905, where it is almost
certainly misplaced by a copyist’s error.
oppido. Cf. 317.
897. quantum potest. Cf. 674.
898. dilapidat, ‘pitches away,' sc. like stones, ‘makes ducks and
drakes of it: ’ not found elsewhere in any classical writer.
903. recepissem, ⁴ Ι had undertaken.’
semel, ‘ once '=‘at some former time,' thus used by Augustan
authors, especially after si, cum, etc.
905. ut. mi esset fides, ‘ to preserve my honour!
906. idque adeo. Cf. 389.
908. ita uti par fuit. ‘ as was fitting!
