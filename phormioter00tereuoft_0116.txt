Danube. At Rome slaves were often named thus after their nation-
ality; e. g. Syrus. Popularis may, however, merely = ‘ fellow-slave,'
according to the custom, not yet obselete, of slaves to identify themselves
with their masters.

36-7. erat ei etc. ‘I had a trifling balance of money on a little

account for some time due to him.’
relicuom. This word is always of four syllables in Lucretius and

the older writers. Lucretius scans relicuos. Catullus, Tibullus, Vergil,
and Horace, unwilling either to lengthen the first syllable or to unite
the two last, avoid the word altogether. Later it is used as a trisyllable,
e. g. by Juvenal, re‘li‘quus. Note the diminutives.

38. id ut conficerem, sc. oravit, curious Ellipse. Translate, ‘ could
I settle it? ‘ In colloquial language the principal verb is often omitted.
Cf. 65, 80, 142, 144, 198, etc.

39. erilem fflium=erifilium, a common phrase in Terence. Cf.
1 28 note. Such words as erus, umerus, umor were never spelt with an

' lz until after the Augustan period.

40. eredo, parenthetical‚ as osten in the comic writers.

41. quam inique comparatum est, ‘ what an- unfair arrangement
it is.’

ii, so A, no MS. reading εἰ· or iv, which is commonly printed in
deference to Ritsehl on Pl. Trin. 17 (Prolegomena, p. 98). Priscian says
that z'z‘ was pronounced as i, and probably was sometimes so written.

43. unciatim, ‘ ounce by ounce.’ The uncia=1¹5 of the as or libra,
which was originally a pound weight of copper. Adverbs in -tim were
probably old Accusative cases.

demenso, ‘rations,' ‘short commons,’ which were served out to
slaves, an allowance proverbially scanty: sometimes called diaria
(dies), as being the daily portion, e. g.. Hor. Ep. 1. 14. 40. Cf. ἁρμαλιή,
Hes. Op. 765.

44. genium, ‘his own self‚’ (from root GEN- in gigno). ‘The
Romans believed that every man had a genius, though their notions on
the subject seem very confused. According to the name it should be
the attendant on a man's birth, as it was believed to be the inseparable
companion of his lise. It represented his spiritual identity, and the
character of the genius was the character of the man.’ Mr. Macleane‘s
note on Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 94. Cf. Hor. Od. 3. 17. 14 Cras genium mero
Curabis, ib. Ep. 2. 2. 187,

Scit genius, natale comes qui temperat astrum,

Naturae deus humanae, mortalzs in unum

Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis, albus et aler.
Ib. 2. 1. 144, Pers. 5. 1 51 indulge genio. Cf. 70 note.
