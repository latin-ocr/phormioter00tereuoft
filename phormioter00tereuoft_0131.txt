hoe nil est: ilicet, ‘ this is nonsense: let us be off.'

moet=ire licet was a formula of dismissal from an assembly,
funeral, or other ceremonial gathering; see Conington's note on Verg-
A· 6. 231. Cf. Ad. 791, where ilicet=‘ it is all up.’

209. quin abeo? ‘why do I not go?’ equivalent in meaning to
‘ I am off? Note the following uses of quin (qui—ne):

(1) ‘ why not ἲ ’ either in direct or indirect questions. As may be
seen from the present passage this meaning passes easily into ‘ indeed,'
‘ verily,' without a question. Cf. 429, 538, 1015.

(2) with Imperatives. This use is a natural development of the
first; for quin taces Ρ is equivalent in sense to tace. Cf. 22 3, 350, 486,
857, 882, 935-

(3) as a corroborative particle, ‘ indeed,’ ‘ verily ; ’ sometimes
further strengthened by etiam. Cf. Ad. 262 quin omnia sibi post putavit
esse prae meo commodo.

(4) in the common sense, ⁴ but that,’ after verbs expressing doubt,
prevention‚ or the like, with a negative. Cf. 272, 697, etc.

note 7), depending on some Imperative like cave or sac under—
stood.

213. saevidicis is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

protelet, only ante· and post-classical, probably derived from pro
and tendo, and so not connected with.either Gr. τῆλε or telum (tex-lum),
‘a miss'ile weapon.' Protelum is used by Cato and Lucilius sor ‘ a
team of oxen hamc-ssed in single file: thence in Lucr. 2. 531 undique
protelo plagarum continuato, ‘ a continuous succession of blows‚’ ib. 4. 190.
So too in legal language protelare=‘ to prolong by successive delays.’

⁴ Here it forcibly expresses the idea of a rapid suceession of attacks

which might prevent Antipho srorn getting in a word of defence. Tr.‚
‘lest in his anger he should rout you with his furious broadsides.’

214. eoactum te esse, sub. responde.

tenes? ‘ do yon understand? ' In the same sense in Andr. 300,
