142 PHORMJO.

l 47¹5.1 nisi, ‘only‚’ ‘ but.‘ Cf. 953. This usage seems to be only col-
oquia .

cessavit eniti, ‘slaekened his exertionst’ cessare= ‘to flag‚’
desinere = ‘ to d esist.'

476. in, not repeated before aliis, as with cum 171.

praebuit, sc. se.

477. confutavit . . . senem, ‘he utterly quenched the old gentleman
when boiling over with rage: ' confutare, lit. ‘to pour cold water into
a vessel which is boiling over.'

478. ego quod potui porro. In full the sentence would be, ego
porro feci quod potuisacere.

480. quid eum? ‘what about him?' In conversational language
an Acc. may be thus loosely used with no verb expressed and probably
with none understood. One essential idea of the Acc is ‘limitation,’
and so an Ace. may be thus employed to limit the question to the
person or thing spoken about. Cf. 755.

aibat=azel1at. Terence seems to have used —2bam or -z‘ebam sor
the Imperf. of the fourth conjugation indifferently‚ e. g. Andr. 38
servibas ; Phor. 83 serviebat. The shorter form was sometimes
employed by later poets, e. g. lenibat, nutribant. vestibat by Vergi1;
audibat, mollibat by Ovid. A ibam, etc., probably represents the
colloquial pronunciation in the time of Terence. The MSS. are so
confused on this point that the reading has usually to be decided by
the metre. Cf. 642.

481. The construction is a mixture of ut aibat, de eius consilio volo
facere, and aibat de eius consilio sese velle fizcere. Cf. Ad. 648 ut
opinor eas non nosse te.

de eius oonsilio, ‘in accordance with his advice : ’ cf. the common
phrases de more, de sententia.

482. metus, Gen. case. Some editors alter the MSS. reading to

meluis, an archaic sorm of the Gen. found once in Heaut. 287 anuis.

huc salvom, sc. venire.

484. eccum. Cf. 464 note.

ab sua palaestra. The term palaestra, ‘wrestling schooL' is here
comically applied to the house where Pamphila lives. because Phaedria
goes there so regularly. Tr. ‘ his special place of exercise.’ '

Aer II. SCENF. 5. [ΙΙΙ. 2.]

Phaedria begs Dorio, the ow ner of Pamphila, to give him three days·
gr.ace D01io is obdurate· he has an offer for the girl, and will not
throw away ready money for tears and promises. F irst come, first
served‚' is his motto.
