are left at Athens in charge¹ of Demipho's confidential slave
Geta.

Act: 1. In the opening soenes Geta narrates his experiences
to his friend Davus. Finding it impossible to control a pair of
wild youths, he gives up the attempt, and lets them follow their
own devices.

Phaedria first falls violently in love with a music-girl named
Pamphila, who is in the hands of a slave-dealer, Dorio, on sale
for thirty minae (Amo). As Phaedria has no money, he can
do nothing but escort his lady-love to and from the school
where she is completing her education.

Just at this time Antipho is told a touching story of a beauty

his father's wrath, and he pours forth his troubles (Sc. 3) into
the unsympathetic ears of his cousin, who considers that he
himself is alone deserving of pity. Geta now (Sc. 4) brings the
news of Demipho’s arrival. Antipho cannot be induced to face
his father, and runs away, leaving Phaedria and Geta to fight his
battles for him.

Both do their best to calm down the irascible old gentleman,
who comes on (Sc. 5) fuming at the news of his son’s unauthor-
ised marriage. In spite of all that can be said, Act I closes with
