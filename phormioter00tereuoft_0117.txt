NOTES. LINES 36—50. 1¹3

comper-sit, ‘has saved ,' spelt comparsit in the Calliopian MSS.

45. ma, i. e. the bride.

46. partum, sub. sit, the Ellipse making the phrase more em-
phatic.

47. ferietur alio munere, ‘ will be hit again,' a colloquial phrase
for losing money which has a parallel in English. Propertius 4. 5. 44
uses serit in a similar sense. In Pl. Trin. 247 ibi pendentem fierit, there
is a play upon the 'ordinary and the colloquial meanings.

48. natalis dies, i. e. at the ἀμφιδρόμια, or name-feast, an Attic
festival, at which the child was carried round the hearth. Birthdays were
scrupulously observed among the Romans also, as occasions for gists
and feasts. Note the proceleusmatic in the second f00t; see Introduction
on Metres, p. 26.

49. inhiabunt, a word of doubtful meaning in this place.

(1) ‘ at his initiation.' either to the family sacra, or to the Eleu—
sinian or other mysteries.

(2) ‘at his weaning,' because according to Varro children were
then initiated to the rites of the deities who presided over eafing,
drinking, and sleeping, Edulz'a (or Edusa), Potica, and Cuba.

Admission to the family sacra is on the whole more probable,
because the ceremony at weaning was purely Roman and so not likely
to be here alluded to. See pp. 16-7. Some editors place only a
comma after dies, supposing that the ‘initiation' took place on the
birthday; but it is more forcible to understand it as a fourth <occasion
for fleecing Geta.

50. mittundi. Cf. 22 note.

eausa, ‘ pretext.'

Ae‘r Ῑ. Scene 2.

Davus is interrupted by the appearance of Geta, who is coming out
to look for him. In the conversation which ensues Geta lets the
audience know the position of affairs3 how impossible he had found it
to control the two young men, Antipho and Phaedria, of whom he had
been left in charge; how Phaedria had become enamoured of a music—
girl whom he was unable to purchase from her master Dorio; how
Antipho likewise had fallen a victim to the charms os a young lady
named Phanium, whom he had first seen at her mother’s funeral ς how
by Phormio’s assistance a suit had been trumped up against Antipho, who
was asserted to be the next-of-kin to Phanium; how, no desence being
made, the marriage had been hastily concluded, with the result that all
