1 70 PHORMIO.

cupio . . . defungier, ‘ 1 wish‚ wretched woman that Ι am, that
this were now the end.'

defungier probably impersonal, as in Ad. 507 utinam lzz'c sit modo
defimctum. The translation, ‘ 1 should like to die at once in my misery‚'
seems to agree neither with the following words nor with Ad. 507.

1022. quid sperem? ‘what can I hope for? ' F leckeisen’s conjec-
ture, qui id sperem, ‘ how can Ι hope for it‚’ is very plausible.

1024. magis expetenda, ‘ more attractive.'

1026. exequias Chremeti . . . ire, a formula used in giving notice
of a funeral. Note the omission of the preposition before exequias.

1027. sie dabo, ‘that's my style,' or ‘such shall be my revenge.’
dare = facere is common in colloquial Latin, in Lueretius and Vergil,
less frequent in Cicero and Livy. We find such· phrases as dare finem,
cuneum, motus, ruinas, discessum, impetum, ete.= facere finem, etc.
Munro on Lucr. 4. 41 quotes Max Miiller, Science of Language‚ 2nd
series, p. 224, ‘ in Latin it was equally impossible to distinguish
between the roots (ἶᾶ and dhd, because the Romans had no aspirated
dentals3 but such was the good sense of the Romans that, when they
felt they could not efficiently keep the two roots apart‚ they kept only
one, dare, to give. and replaced the other dare, to place or to make, by
different verbs] such as ponere, facere) .

It seems possible that such uses ofdare as are given above may be sur-
vivals in popular or poetical language of dare from root dha. Cf. 974, ete.

1028. faxo. Cf. 308 note. Two MSS. read saxo tali sit mactatus.

mactatum, ‘ victimised.' For the various senses of maclare see
Lewis and Short. With this reading note lzz‘c‚· cf. 266 note.

1030. habet, . . . ogganniat, ‘she has something to din (lit. snarl)
into his ears as long as he lives.' Note ἒῖ.

1031. at meo merito, sc. hoc videtur sactum. Cf. 1033. At first
sight it looks as if this repetition of the same phrase (1031 and 1033)
were due to some corruption of the text: but in the mouth of the
outraged Nausistrata it is perhaps natural enough.

103 3. minume gentium! ‘ not the least in the world 1’ gentium is
a partitive Genitive, cf. nusquam gentium, ποῦ γῆς, etc.

1034. fieri infectum non potest, ‘ cannot be made unmade ;’ this
infectum is a compound of z’n and sactum, to be distinguished from
infictus, Pers. Part. Pass. of inficio, ‘ Ι stain,' ‘ corrupt.’

1035. purgat, ‘ he apologises.‘

1037. Nausistrata like Sophrona, Phaedria, cf. 830 note.

prius quam is thus used with a Pres. Indic. when the event or act
referred to is regarded as certain, otherwise with a Subj„ e. g. Ad. 583
prius quam adportant venias.
