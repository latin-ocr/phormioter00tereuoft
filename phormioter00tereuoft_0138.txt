Ι 34 PHORMJO.

320. quid si reddet? ‘ What if he shall give the girl back‘l’ It
might however be, ‘ What if he shall reply 3 ' Cf. 877 note. Note that
from 317 to 320 Phormio is buried in thought, uttering aloud only

disconnected fragments of sentences, and paying no attention whatever
to Geta's ejaculations.

321. cedo senem, ⁴ bring the old fellow out.’ Cf. 197 note.

322. erimine, ‘ rep1·oach.’

323. derivem, ‘divert,' a metaphor from turning the current of a
stream (de-rivus).

32 5. in nervom erumpat, ‘ should end by landing you in the stocks?

nervom, lit. ‘ a sincwss then ‘a setter,' especially used of a setter
for the feet and sometimes the neck, like our stocks or pillory. This
use of erumpat is colloquial.

326. periclum, ‘trial‚’ its original sense.

iam pedum visa est via, ⁶ I can keep my feet out of harm's way

329· cedo dum, ‘tell me now.' dum is often used by the comic
writers as an enclitic with Imperatives and Interjections, e. g. ehodum ;
and we also find quidum (interrogative) and primumdum. In later
Latin this use of -dum is confined to agedum, agitedum, and nondum,
nedum, vixdum, dudum, interdum. Cf. 594, 784, etc.

enumquam) in animated questions where the answer ‘ no ' is expected:

senting the vulgar pronunciation.

bearing trees.'
332. quia enim, ‘ because indeed.’ Cf. 113 note.
