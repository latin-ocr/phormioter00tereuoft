NOTES. LJNES 970-1021. 169

990. qui nominat me—'? Nausistrata begins to speak while she
is scarcely out of the door. Before she has time to finish her sentence
(with homo perhaps), her eyes sall on the termination of the violent
struggle before the house, and she breaks off with an exclamation of
surprise. This explains qui, which otherwise would have been quis.
Cf. 618 note.

991. quis hic homo est, P ‘ who is this fellow here ’ἒ ’ Cf. 618 note.

99²· hicine ut . . . respondeat. Cf. 304 note.

993. credun. All MSS. give credas ; but the archaic form seems
necessary for the metre. Plautus uses creduam, creduas, creduat: also
creduis, creduit.

994. abi. Cf. 59 note.

totus friget, ‘all as cold as a stone} i. e. with fright. Cf. Pl.
Most. 4. 2. 1 totus gaudeo.

998. quod. Cf. 155 note.

1001. tibi narret Ρ ‘ is he to tell the tale for you ⁸? '

factum ost abs te sedulo, ‘ you have managed matters nicely.'

1005. mi homo 1 ‘ my good man 1 ’

1009. hodie, ‘ in our time.'

1012. haecine. Cf. 58 note.

1014. The order is non nego eum meritum esse culpam in hac re.

1015. sed ea quin sit ignoscenda? ⁴ but why should that be
unpardonable? quin --- ‘why not,' cf. 209. Donatus, followed by
Bentley, considered the phrase as an Aposiopesis, negare non poteris
or the like being understood. Others repeat non nego before quin, sc.
sed non nego quin ea sit ignoscenda, which does not seem very forcible.

verba fiunt mortuo: a doubtful phrase, (1) ‘you are wasting
words on the dead 3 ’ or, ‘ you might as well talk to the dead,' sc. as to
Nausistrata: cf. Pl. Bacch. 519 nihilo plus refiret Quam si ad sepul-
chrum mortuo dixit logos.

(2) ‘his funeral oration is being pronounced,' a sarcastic allusion
to Demipho's feeble excuses for Chremes, which are represented as the
laudatio usually delivered at a funeral, perhaps here suggested by
sepultus sum 943, cf. 1026.

1016. tua . . . tuo, objective use.

1019. 0 medio abiit, ‘has departed? Cf. 16, 967 notes.

qui, attracted into the gender of scrupulus.

serupulus. Cf. 954 note.

1021. quid ego aequo animo, sc.feram ? ‘ how can 1 bear it calmly?

Act, and raised again at the conclusion (aulaea tollere). Cf. Hor. Ep.
2. 1. 189 quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas, Verg. G. 3.
2 purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.
