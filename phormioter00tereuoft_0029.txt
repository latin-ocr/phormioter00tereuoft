METRES AND PROSODY.

The object of this Introduction is to explain briefly the metres

’ employed by Terence in the Phormio, and to clear up such
⁷ apparent difficulties of Prosody as may remain after the general

scheme of the metres is understood.

Tbese metres are Iambic and Trochaic, which receive their
names from being composed of iambi or trochees‚ as the case
may be, or of some other feet, considered to be equivalent: and
the lines are further subdivided according to the number of
metres which they contain‚ and according to their complete or
incomplete form. In iambic and trochaic lines a series of two
feet is called a melre (or dtpodia), and the name of the line
corresponds to the number of these metres3 thus an iambic
trimeter is an iambic line containing three metres or six feet;
atrochaic tetrameter is a trochaic line containing four metres
or eight feet. Again‚ some lines have a number of complete

ζ feet3 these are called acatalectic; while others are called cata-

lectic‚ because the last foot is incomplete. Thus a trochaic
tetrameter catalectic is a trochaic line of four metres or eight

feet, wanting the last syllable, and really containing only seven
feet and a hals.
