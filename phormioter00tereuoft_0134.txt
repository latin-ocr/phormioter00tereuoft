Cf. 297, 304 notes.

262. lenem patrem illum . . . me, ‘that 1, formerly (illum) the
kindest of fathers!

264. similia omnia, ‘it ’s all of a piece.’

congruont. Cf. 9 note.

266-7. ‘When A gets into trouble, B is his advocate: when B is in a

hio as Nom. Sing. is usually short in Plautus and Terence, long in
Augustan poets. See however 1028.

268. inprudens, ⁶ unwittingly,’ because he knows nothing of
Phaedria's love-affairs.

269. eum illo haud stares, ‘you would not be his partisan :' stare·
ab aliquo or ab alicuius causa=‘ to be on a man's side:' stare pro
aliqu0= ‘ to be a man's champion.’

270. si est, ‘ if it is the fact.’

271. minus . . . temperans, ‘he was inconsiderate as to fortune or
to fame‚’ i. e. in marrying a penniless girl of ignoble birth. rei and

a Dat.‚ but temperans is also found with a Gen. = ‘ temperate in.’

dico. Cf. 209 note.

give the Abl. Conversely fruor is constructed with the Abl. in Terence,
except in Heaut. 401, where the Acc. is found: utor takes an Abl. except
perhaps in Ad. 815, but abutor an Acc. For potior cf. 469 note. Lucre-
tius constructs fungor, fruor, potior with Acc.; abutor with Acc. and Abl.

284. timidum. Antipho being really of a timid nature, cf. 204 sqq. ‚
this statement sounded plausible enough.

obstupefecit. When preceded by a short syllable the e in com· .
pounds of this class is usually shortened, following the analogy of the

289. iam dudum . . . audio, ‘I have been hearing you for some

time ; ’ cf. Fr. depuis long7‘emp5 je vous entends.

8 38 ‘just now,’in Pl. Trin. quam dudum ? = ‘how long ago ’θ’ Cf. 459, 471.
