In this Play, as in the Adelphi‚ the division of Acts and Scenes in
the MSS. is dramatically impossible, and is doubtless due to a copyist's
ignorance. This edition adopts the arrangement found in practice to
be the most natural and convenient, but the old numbering os Acts and
Scenes is preserved in brackets for purposes of reference.

Terence probably wrote his plays to be performed without a break.
The division into Acts was most likely made by grammarians of the
Augustan or a later age.

Acr Ι. Seme 5. [Aer II. SCENE 1.]

Demipho is boiling over with rage at his son’s unauthon‘sed and
imprudent marriage. Phaedria loyally defends his cousin, and assisted
by Geta makes every possible excuse. Between them they manage to
divert the old man’s wrath upon Phormio's head.

2 31. itane tandem, etc„ ‘ is it possible that A. has actually married
a wise?’ itane emphasises the question which is further strengthened
by tandem, as frequently in Cicero. Cf. 315, 373, 413, 527.
