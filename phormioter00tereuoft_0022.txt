18 INTRODUCTION.

respectability and a civilised consideration for others, except
where the natural impulses inspire a generous disposition with
something of nobility.

The discerning criticism of Caesar nearly expresses the more
matured judgment of modern times:

Tu quoque, tu in summis, O dimz'dz'ate Menander,
Ponerz's et merito, puri sermonis amator.

Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta foret vis
Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore

Cum Graecis neque z'n hac despectus parte iaceres,-
Unmn hoc maceror ac doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

Not that Terence was devoid of humour ; but his humour is so
delicate and refined that it must often have fallen flat upon the
stage. When‘his plays are well known their subtle satire and
polished wit can be appreciated3 but there is without doubt an
absence of enei-gy and action (Caesar's vis comica), which
prevented his pieces from being dramatically successful. An
audience must be educated up to his plays before it can perceive
their many excellences.
