ROMAN COMEDY ΛΝΒ TERENCE. 15

of Plautus, were Comoediae palliatae, i. e. plays wherein the
scene and characters are Greek, as opposed to Comoediae
togatae, where the scene is laid in Rome or at least in Italy.
N ational tragedies and dramas were called Fabulae Praetextae.

Terence's first comedy, the Andria, was produced 166 B.C.
Suetonius relates that when this play was offered to the Aediles,
the young author was told to submit it to the judgment of
Caecilius. Terence arrived when the veteran poet was at supper,
and being in mean attire was seated on a stool near the table.
But he had read no more than a few lines, when Caecilius bade
him take a place upon his conch, and bestowed high commenda-
tion on the play. As Caecilius died in 168 B.C., the Andria
must have been in manuscript at least two years before its
performance, and some colour is given to the above anecdote by
the mention which Terence makes in the Prologue of the ill-
natured criticisms of Luscius Lanuvinus. The Hecyra, his
second play, proved his least successful one. At its first per-
formance in 165 B.C., the audience deserted the theatre to look
at some boxers ; a similar fate attended a second representation
in 160⁴ B.C., and only the personal intercession of the manager,
Ambivius Turpio, secured it a hearing at all. The Heauton
Timorumenos appeared in 163, the Eunuchus and Phormio in
161, the Adelphi in 160. In the same year Terence visited
Greece, either to study for himself Athenian manners and
customs, or, as some assert, to escape the persecution of his
enemies. According to one account ¹ he perished by shipwreck
in 159 B.C., as he was returning to Italy with no less than 108
of Menander’s comedies translated into Latin. A more general
belief was that he died at Stymphalus, in Arcadia, from grief on
hearing of the loss of his MSS„ which he had sent on before
him by sea. Porcius Licinus narrates that his noble patrons
suffered him to die in such abject poverty that he had not even
a lodging at Rome whither a slave might have brought news of
his death. This is probably untrue‚ for Suetonius writes that he
