146 PHORMJO.

Ac‘r II. SCENE 6. [ΙΙΙ. 3.]

Phaedria, in despair, implores the aid of Geta, who eventually under-
takes by some means to procure the money in time.

535. The scansion is doubtful. It might be quoi mim'ls 1 nihilo est Ι
quod Ιιῖι· si Ι pote fu Ι isset 1 etc„ or quoi mi 1 nus nihi Ι lo est quod
lzi‘c 1 si pote Ι fuisset Ι etc. Wagner lengthens quod, making the vthird

foot quod hic, but this is improbable.
hio si . . . exorarier, ‘if only this three days' grace, could have

been wheedled out of him.’ In this passage si is not strictly condi·
tional, but expresses a wish, exactly as in the corresponding English
ldlongotae. Cf. 379 note.

536. fuerat, Indicative because the promise was a fact, cf. 513.

537. dudum. Cf. 289 note.

dixti. Cf. 198 note.
adiuerit=adiuverit. The metre shows that adiuerit most nearly

represents the pronunciation. Cf. Ennius, apud Cic. Senec. 1. 1 adiuero.
538. quin. Cf. 209.
539. equidem, from quidem, compounded with the intensive particle
e, as in ecastor, edepol, enim, and perhaps edurus. It does not stand for
ego quidem, and, though more common with the first person singular, is
also found with other persons and numbers: e. g. Eun. 956 atque
equidem orante, ut ne lzoc faceret, Thaide ; Pl. Pers. 2. 2. 5 equidem si

scis ; Pl. Epid. 4. 2. 33 adulescentem equidem dicebant emisse ; Sall. Cat. ,

52. 16 vanum equidem lzoc consilium est.
540. id unde, sc. inveniam ; cf. 38 note.
542. Note Hiatus after itane. See Introduction, p. 31.
etiam tu hino abis Ρ ‘ out with you !’ Cf. Eun. 799 non tu hinc
abis? Ad. 550 etiam taces? ‘do be quiet! This is better than to
translate, ‘ What! are you too going to leave me in the lurch ’θ’ etiam is
osten thus used to emphasise questions or imperatives; cf. 474.

543-4. ‘ Can't I congre-tulate myself on not having got into trouble
about your marriage, without your hidding me now jump out of the
frying-pan into the fire for your cousin as well?’ in malo quaerere
crucem, lit. ‘ when in trouble already to seek for the gallows.’

546. parum. A final m in Latin was very lightly pronounced,
so that parum practically = paru'. Hence the elision of such syl-
lableS.

547. preci. Note that Nom. and Gen. Sing. of this word are
nowhere found, Dat. and Ace. Sing. only in ante-Augustan writers.
Cf. Andr. 601.
