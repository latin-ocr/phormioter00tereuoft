Aer I. SCENE 4.

Geta appears in great perturbation‚ having heard of the sudden arrival

the sticking-point, but in vain. When the old man is seen approaching
Antipho hurriedly decamps, leaving his cousin to bear the brunt of his
father’s anger.

179. nullus ee, ‘you are done for,' a colloquial phrase. Cf. 942,

Andr. 599.

celere. This is the usual form of the adverb in Terence.

reperis, Here repperis is found in A B C D F P, reppereris in
D2 G and Priscian, repereris E. Probably reperis is the true reading,
as mistakes of this sort often occur in the MSS.; e. g. in 192 five good
MSS. read repperiam for reperiam.

180. te inpendent. A very rare construction, inpendere being
followed by Dat. or in with Ace. Cf. Lucilius ut quae res me inpendet

of the Greek proverb πλίνθον πλύνεις. The meaning is. ‘it would be
wonse than useless.’ Greek bricks were made of clay baked in the sun,
so that the more they were washed the more dirty they would become.
Cf. Xen. Hell. 5. 2. 5.

187. quom . . . tum. This sentence shows well how these con-
junctions‚ at first purely temporal, come ιο be used as particles of eon-
nexion. Here you might translate, ‘while’ . . . ‘then‚' or ‘not only‘
. - . ‘but also.'

animi is a'Locative like humi, domi, etc.: cf. Ad. 610 discrucior

animi.
