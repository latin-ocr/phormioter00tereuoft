Ac‘r III. SCENE 6. [V. 1.]

Chremes is startled by the sudden appearance of Sophrona, a servant
of his Lemnian wife, from Demipho's house. He learns from her the
death of her mistress and the marriage of Phanium to Antipho. At
first he fails to identify his own daughter with Phormio's ward, and
thinks that his nephew like himself must have married two wives: but
the confusion 1s soon removed and his Joy is unbounded.

730. suasum, ‘advicess only ante· and post· -classicaL
732. nam quae = quaenam, ‘why‘? wh0?‘
a fratre, ‘ from my brother’s house: ’ a common idiom‚ e. g. 795, etc.

733. infirmas, ‘ insecure,’ because divorce was so easy, and parental
authority so great, that no marriage could be safely depended on with-
out the father's consent.

735. edepol, ‘ by Pollux,' shorter ¹form pol 747. The prefix is from the
interjection e, as in e-castor, and perhaps a syncopated vocative of deus.

736. quid agot> Cf. 447 note, and 73.7

737. adeo. ..maneo cognosco, ‘am Ito approach, etc. Note ’

that this use of the Pres. Ind. for Pres. Subj. is usually 1n animated
speech, making the effect more vivid. Cf. 447 note.

741. istm-sum <isto- vorsuml, ‘that way.’ Chremes is now standing
between Sophrona and the house.

742. appellassis, usually considered as syncopated from appellaveris,
as excessis And. 790, from excesseris ,· cf. Zumpt, 5 161. But Madv.
ξ 115 f. and Roby {§ 291—3 consider both these forms, like saxo, ausim,
etc„ to be remnants of an archaic Future in -so (Ind.)‚ -sim (Subjs,
while King and Cookson, pp. 462-3, hold amasso, amas-sim, etc„ to be
conjunctive and optative forms of the sigmatic aorist. In Plautus is
found an Inf. in -assere, e. g. impetrassem. Cf. 308 note. It may be
noted that here the Pcrf. Subj. would be the tense naturally expected.
Livy uses adclarassis, 1. 18. -

743. sti ‘ hist.’ This exclamation scans as a long syllable.

744. conclusam, the word applied to a wild beast in a cage. Tr.
‘ 1 have a ferocious wife caged up there)

745. perperam, ‘ falsely,' used by Cicero; Gr. πέρπερος.

746. effutiretis, ‘ should blurt it out ;' connected with futilis, fundo.

pon-0, ‘ afterwards,' ‘ later on.' The more remote in a succession
of events seems the essential idea. Cf. 923, 937, 102 5.
