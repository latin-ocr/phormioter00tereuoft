conclusion from them; cf. Gr. συμβάλλειν, and Juv. 6. 436 committit

168. ut no addam, ‘ not to mention? Terence uses ut ne=ne nega-
tive purpose, e. g. 245, 314, 415, Andr. 2 59, and also=ut non negative

‘provided that not : ’ ib. Lael. 42, 43, 60, 65, etc.
ingenuam liberalem, ‘ a lady born and bred.'

171. scelere, ‘rascal.'

quo=quocum, which the later MSS. give.
¹7²· plerique omnes, ‘ almost all of us ; ’ the same phrase is found
Andr. 55, Pl. Trin. 29.
nostri nosmet, poenitet, ‘ we are ever discontented with our lot.‘
nosmet. The suffix -met = ‘sels' is attached to ego and tu, rarely
to meus. Conversely -pte=‘self,’ ‘own‚’ is commonly affixed to pos-
sessive prononns, rarely to persona] pronouns; while -tc is found with
cases of tu only. Cf. 280, 467, 766, 914.

173. videre. Plautus and Terence usually prefer the form in ·re of
second pers. sing. pass. to that in ·ris except for metrical reasons.
Cicero and Vergil follow the same custom except in the Pres. Ind. On
the other hand Livy and Tacitus seldom use the form in -re.

174. de integro, ‘sreely.' The phrase Andr. 26=‘anew.' In both
cases the derivative meaning (in privative and stem of lango) is easily
traced.

etiam (Gr. ἔτι), ‘even yet.’ as often.

175. retinere, amare, amittere. So all MSS. Most editors, seeing
the alternatives neque mittendi nec retinendi in 176, get rid of amare ;
e. g. retinere amorem an mittere (Dz., Fleck., etc.): retinere eam anne
amittere (B. and· W. following Dz. first ed.). Bentley reads relinere
amare an mittere. To add amare to retinere is no doubt more lover·
like than logical, but that seems hardly sufficient reason for altering
Antipho's words, which all MSS. give without variation.

For amittere cf. 141 note.

176. ut neque mihi sit amittendi. So Δ. with Donatus and
Servius. This reading involves the scansion milis, which is uncommon
in Terence. B C D E G P with A, insert eius aster sit. If this
reading be accepted it is an instance of the gerund used in a purely
substantival sense, with a genitive aster it, ‘of the dismissal of her3’ cf.
Heaut. 29 novarum qm spectandi faciunt coptam, Hec. 372 etus (sc.
uxorate) videndi cupidus recta consequor. This construction, which also
occurs in Plautus, Lucretius, Cicero, and Suetonius, is instructive as
