NOTES. LINES 1 77-197. 1 25

188. nam absque eo esset, ‘for were it not for him.’ Plautus and
Terence only use absque in the protasis of conditional sentences with si
‘omitted as here. In the Augustan period absque is only used ⁴in a few
quasi-juridical formulae, e. g. absque sententia, ‘without judgment? Cf.

x Pl. Trin. 832, 1¹²7·

absque was formed by adding -que (its copulative force being lost)
to abs, which was a collateral form of ab (cf. ἐκ, ἐξ), used before words
beginning with c, q, t. As early however as Plautus, absis rarely found
except before te. Cicero usually wrote abs te up to about Β. c. 55.
Occasional uses of abs in later authors, e. g. Livy, are probably in—
tentional archaisms. In ‹ts-pello, crs-porto. a-spernor (for ets-spernor),
the b has fallen out. Cf. Pl. Pers. 159 abs clcorago; infra 201, 378,
617, 840.

189. vidissem =pr0vzdzksem‚ colloquial.

190. aliquid convasassem‚ ‘I should bave packed a few things
togetherz' convasare is ἅπαξ λεγόμενονὶη classrcal literature It ιο· taken
from the military phrase vasa collegere,‘ to pack up.’ The few things
would be of course his master's property.

protinam, archaic form of prfftinus, but scanned prb‘tInam, ἅπαξ

· λεγ. in Terence. All MSS. here read protinus, but Donatus gives pro·

tinam, which is required by the mette and confirmed by Pl. Bacc.

192. qua quaerere insistam via f· ‘where (lit. by what road) shall
1 begin to look for him ‘2 ' insistere, ‘ to stand ’ or ⁶ press upon ’ may
be constructed with a Dat. or in with Abl. or a simple Acc. ; while in
the sense of ‘to set about,' ‘to begin‚’ it is followed by an Ins. as here.
A confusion of these usages probably accounts sor the reading viam in
Δ. F G. In Eun. 294 quam insistam viam? there is no Infinitive.

193. neseio quod magnum . . . malum, ‘ some great calamity or
other) If nescio quod had meant ‘ 1 do not know what,’ the following
verb would have been in the Subj. Nescio quid, ‘ somewhat,’ is often
used to qualify a verb or adjective. Nescio may be scanned as a dactyl,
or as a spondee by Synizesis. Cf. p. 31.

194. aanun=sanusne.

ὁ ibi plurimum est, ‘ he is mostly there.'

195. ilico may here be of place, ‘where you are,’ or of time, ‘at

once.’ Cf. 88 note.
satis pro inperio, sub. loqueris, ‘ you give your orders peremp-
torily enough?

196. The grammatical order is lpse est obviam, quem volui, ‘ here is
the very man Ι want.' Cf. Andr. 5 32 eccum ipsum obviam.

197. οόᾱό, ‘tell me.’ This archaic imperative ζ( tell me’ or ‘give
