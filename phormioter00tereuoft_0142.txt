1 38 PHORMJO.

Vergil constantly uses it in this intensive sense, e. g. A. 3. 203 tres

adeo . . . soles, ‘ three whole days‚' ib. 7. 629 etc.
3. ‘ Moreover‚' ‘ besides ’ (rare).
quid. mea, sc. reffert. Cf. 133, 723 note.

392. non te horum pudet Ρ The same meaning is expressed Ad.
7 54 by non te haec pudent ,2 the verb being either personal or impersonal
in Terence ε but when personal the N ominative is usually a neuter pro-
noun. The above seems more probable than to refer horum to
Demipho's friends.

393. talentfim=talentorum‚ as nummilm etc. An Attio talent=60
minae=g243 155. Cf. 644.

394—5. esses proferens=prqferres. This is an early instance of the
tendency of Latin, as of other languages, to become‘ analytic3 ' i. e. to
express changes of case, tense, mood, voice, or person by the addition of ⁷
separate wor‚ds e. g. prepositions‚ auxiliary verbs, pronouns, etc„ in-
stead of by case· endings or verbal inflexions. The latter method is
called‘ synthetic.' Greek is a good example of a ‘synthetic,' English
of an ‘ analytic ' language. Analytic varieties are, however, more frequent
in Greek than Latin. Cf. And. 508, 775 ut sis sciens=ut scias, ·Cic.
Verr. i. 40 distributum habere :distribuisse .· infra 946, 974.

atavo, ‘great-great-great-grandfather.' The ascending steps of

paternal ancestry were pater, avus, proavus, abavus ( =avi avus), atavus,
tritavus < = avi-avi-avusx

396. ‘ Exactly so: on coming before the court,' i.e. to claim his
inheritance.

qui. Cf. 123 note.
397. face, archaic forsac, cf. 309 note.
398. cedo. Cf. 197 note. qui. Cf. 123 note.
eu, Gr. ευ, so eu cre, Gr. εὖγε. Tr. ‘well done our side!

400. si fuerat. The Pluperf.1ndic.after sz‘ is rare.

401. filium narras mihi ἱ) ‘ What! talk to me of my son?'
Terence sometimes uses narrare: · to speak about,’ ⁴ to mention?

402. potest, impersonal‚ cf. 303.

403. magistratus adi, ‘ make an application before the magistrates,’
so followed by ut and Subj. because equivalent to a verb of asking.

405. solus regnas. Cf. Ad. 175 regnumne, Aeschine, tu hic
possides? Pl. Trin. 695 quid ? te dictatorem censes fore ? This can
hardly be considered as a distinctively Roman allusion, since a ‘ tyrant '
at Athens was almost as great a bug-bear as a ⁶ king ' at Rome. Phormio
would of course lay special emphasi: on alterum, cadem, bis, as well as

on solus regnas and solz.
To have a case heard twice was illeg² ⁷al at Athens, cf. Dem. Lept.
