138. Pyrrhus in Ennius An. ²04 is made to say . . . quidve ferat sors
virtute experiamur. This makes the sentiment in Geta's mouth yet
more absurd.

139. hem! Cf.. 52 note.
140. laudo, ‘ bravo l’
ad precatorem adeam, credo, ‘ 1 am to hetake myself to an in·
tercessor‚ I suppose.’ From allusions in the comedians, e. g. Heaut.
976, 1002, we gather that it was customaiy for a slave when in trouble
to enlist the services of a precator. For credo parenthetieal cf. 40.

141. amitte hunc, ‘let him off ς’ often in this sense in Plautus and
Terence. Donatus says, quod nos dicimus dimittere, antiqui etiam dice—
bant amittere. Cf. 175, 176, 414, 918.

142—3.- si quiequam, sub. faciat.

nil=an emphatic non ,· so also nullus, cf. Andr. 370· CH. Libera-
tus sum hodie, Dave, tua opera. DA. Ac nullus quidem.

tantummodo non addit, ‘ the only thing he leaves out.’

vel ὄοοὶᾱὶῒιο, ‘you may kill him if you like.’ In such sentences
reference is made to the original sense of vel (from volo). On the
quantity see p. 28. The F uture Imperative is often used in familiar
language of a single act, for the sake of greater emphasis. Cf. 166,
984.

144. paedagogus ille. Phaedria is cornically so called because he

escorted his music-girl to and from her school like a παιδαγωγός.
qui citharistriam, sc. sectatur. Cf. 86.
145. quid rei gerit Ρ ‘ how does he get on ?'
sic, tenuiter, ‘ so so, but poorly.’ Cf. 5.

P· 31·

147. quid Ρ ‘ I say.' Cf. 64 note.

point of time are you waiting for 3 ’ quoad :quod ad =ad quod.

150. portitores, ‘the custom-house officers‚' who collected the por·
toria, harbour-dues. All letters brought by sea seem to have passed
beneath their censorship. Cf. Pl. Trin. 793, 810.

151. num quid aliud me vis Ρ ‘is there an) thing further you want
me sor?’ A common formula of leave-taking. Cf. 458, Ad. 247, Pl.
Trin. 192, Hor. Sat. 1. 9. 6. Note the double Acc. aster vis, as aster a
verb of asking. This construction is used by Terence more freely than
by Augustan writers, e.g. with incuso 914, condono 947.

ut bene sit tibi, the polite rejoinder, which was changed by Demea
in reply to Syrus, Ad. 432, to ‘ Mentem vobis meliorem dari]
